# Design Decisions
The project is based on the original github repo [MLinPractice](https://github.com/lbechberger/MLinPractice) by Lucas Bechberger.
As part of the ML in Practice module of the course of studies in Cognitive Science/Cognitive Computing at University of Osnabrueck, the project is expaned in various parts by [Hendrik Timm](https://github.com/sweedp) and [Jacqueline Naether](https://github.com/jackylinelein).
In the following, our design decisions of our adjustments inside the project are presented and briefly explained to ensure the traceability of our decisions.

## Preprocessing

## Feature Extraction

## Dimensionality Reduction

## Classification

### Classifier
- We implemented a new kind of classifier, using the dummy classifier class. It predicts on lable frequency in the training data.

### Evaluation Metrics
- We have integrateed different evaluation metrics newly learned in the lecture into our project as an extra. These are precision, cohen's kappa, recall and f1 measure.

## Unit Tests
