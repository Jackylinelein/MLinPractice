# Design Decisions
The project is based on the original github repo [MLinPractice](https://github.com/lbechberger/MLinPractice) by Lucas Bechberger. As part of the ML in Practice module in winter term 2021/2022 of the course of studies Cognitive Science/Cognitive Computing at University of Osnabrueck, the project is expaned in various parts by [Hendrik Timm](https://github.com/sweedp) and [Jacqueline Naether](https://github.com/jackylinelein). In the following, the design decisions of the adjustments inside the project are presented and briefly explained to ensure the traceability of the decisions.

## Preprocessing

## Feature Extraction

## Dimensionality Reduction

## Classification

### Classifier
- A new kind of classifier was implemented, using the dummy classifier class. It predicts on lable frequency in the training data.

### Evaluation Metrics
Different evaluation metrics newly learned in the lecture were integrated into the project as an extra. These are:
- precision
- cohen's kappa
- recall
- f1 measure

## Unit Tests
